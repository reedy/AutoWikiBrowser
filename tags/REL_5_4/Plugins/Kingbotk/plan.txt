Extend pluginbase to include all logic, which can be read from XML (existing complicated plugins can use hard-coded settings blocks)
-Easier alternative, make an extended generic template class, which is serialisable, and retain existing architecture
-Another alternative is simply to bolt parameter defining onto the existing generic template model

Generic template creation wizard, step user through setting up all the params we currently hard code

Add article reading with stub and infobox recognition - perhaps in assessments mode only initially, to test it, then for bots when proven?
-HasInfobox and IsStub should probably go into AWB/WikiFunctions actually

Perhaps have a protected wiki list of templates which should be moved into the container shells; pages which have more than 2 such templates would get a new container. The regexes might be difficult as template instances could include extra sets of curly brackets and all sorts of muck.
-This would be universally useful and probably ought to go into AWB/WikiFunctions or WikiFunctions2
