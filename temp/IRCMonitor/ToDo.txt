* Add user-related functions (block, see contribs etc.) - partially done
* Move a lot of hardcoded things to settings - mostly done. AIV is the issue.
* Add support of other projects.
* Make code to guess new section name if needed when issuing warnings.
* Track user's other contribs when loading diffs.
* Handle edit conflicts
